# Flu-Shot-Learning-Predict-H1N1-and-Seasonal-Flu-Vaccines

The Flu Shot Learning: Predict H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines dataset is a supervised learning experience hosted by DrivenData. The goal of the dataset is to predict how likely individuals are to receive their H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines. There are two target variables: one for the H1N1 vaccine and one for the Seasonal Flu vaccine. Each row in the dataset represents one person who responded to the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey. The target variables are clearly defined and binary already, which will aid in ease of preprocessing .
